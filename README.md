A Decentralized Ice Cream Loyalty Ecosystem Built on the Solana Blockchain.  The proposed system leverages blockchain technology, a dedicated wallet app, and a native cryptocurrency to replace traditional punchcard systems. This ecosystem benefits both customers and ice cream shop owners by providing a seamless, secure, and efficient loyalty program, along with additional features such as in-app purchases, a map of participating shops, and a merchant portal for enhanced business management.
